# OOP vs Structured Programming

### Structured Programming

- Thinking in terms of Procedures/methods/functions

### Object Oriented Programming

- Thinking about Object that involve to solve the problem.
- What is the Data they need(State)
- What are the actions they perform(Before)
- Eg: Object(Aeroplane). Data (airlineName, type, position). Actions (takeOff(),land(),cruise()).

### Encapsulation

- Only class members should have the access to class's instance variables.
- Other classes should not change the data of the current class directly. They have to do it through the behaviour of the current class i.e., through methods like getters and setters.
- [Example Code](oop/MotorBike.java)
