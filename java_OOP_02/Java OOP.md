# OOP vs Structured Programming

### Structured Programming

- Thinking in terms of Procedures/methods/functions

### Object Oriented Programming

- Thinking about Object that involve to solve the problem.
- What is the Data they need(State)
- What are the actions they perform(Before)
- Eg: Object(Aeroplane). Data (airlineName, type, position). Actions (takeOff(),land(),cruise()).
